# EDA_project
This is my exploratory data analyst (EDA) project where I prepared data and visualized them using packages such as Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib.
The code itself includes explanatory note (#...) where I explain the function of the code, but to give you an overview, my target is to preview the data given from excel file named "supermarket_sales", which is a free-source of dataset. Then prepare data by adding columns, changing data types, dealing with duplicate rows and missing values. And finally, plotting relationships between fields to display the impact from one to another. 
I also included an pdf file displays the result and steps in more detail so feel free to check them out.
